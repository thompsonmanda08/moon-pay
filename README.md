This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Ideally you would want to create a fork of your own to your account then clone the repo from your account as `origin`, that way you can submit Pull Requests to the original repo and it will not affect your repo in any way.

To clone this repo run the command: `git clone git@github.com:thompsonmanda08/moon-pay.git`

After cloning the repo the following instructions below will help you spin up a development server on your local repo and you will be able to run the app.

## TO GET STARTED

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

### RUN THE APP

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
